# book-list
I took time to use Javascript class constructor to create the book list. Book can be added and be removed.
I wrote the code with ES5 and ES6. You can link any of the JS files with the html and it will run fine.
Every book added is saved into the local storage and unless it is outrightly deleted then it deletes from the local storage.
This book-list is created with core Javascript, HTML5 and CSS.
